The first heretical idea is to think in terms of small text blocks, not paragraphs. You drag a block, duplicate it, or delete it without selecting any text, thus saving time."},{"v":"2. The second heretical idea is to use invisible minimalistic Markdown-like syntax to markup the information. No other design tools. This will focus you on the quality & value of your text."},{"v":"3.
