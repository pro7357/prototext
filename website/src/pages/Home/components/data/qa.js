But I love computers because they can be like a second brain. I record all my ideas, structure them, connect them, and use AI as an assistant."},{"v":"I have tested various mind mapping programs before, such as Trello, Coggle, and Diagrams.net. They all have a structured format, such as a tree-like, card-like, or schematic. A raw stream of thoughts, however, has no structure. Prototext offers the ability to work with a flat stack, which is the simplest representation of data. There is freedom in this."},{"v":"Why not use MS Word, you say? Yes, Word is suitable for organizing a lot of ideas. However, it lacks the flexibility and speed of ProtoText's content blocks."},{"v":"I have seen from my experience how ideas start to progress and their quality increases.

The first heretical idea is to think in terms of small text blocks, not paragraphs. You drag a block, duplicate it, or delete it without selecting any text, thus saving time."},{"v":"2. The second heretical idea is to use invisible minimalistic Markdown-like syntax to markup the information. No other design tools. This will focus you on the quality & value of your text."},{"v":"3. Write non-linearly as ideas come to you. Move the blocks with the best ideas from drafts to the final version pages. Connect complex scenarios using links.
