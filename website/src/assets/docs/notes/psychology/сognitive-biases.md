###Cognitive biases

**When there is a lot of information**

Tend to notice more what we previously remembered or frequently encountered.

Weird, funny, visually appealing, anthropomorphic things tend to attract attention more than the familiar, unfunny ones.

We notice when something has changed.

Details that confirm existing beliefs tend to be appealing.

We tend to notice flaws in others much better than in ourselves.

**When there is not enough meaning**

We discover stories and patterns even in scarce data.

We fill in gaps in information with familiar features from stereotypes, generalizations, and past experience.

We value familiar, likable things and people more than unfamiliar, unlikable ones.

We simplify numbers and probabilities to make them easier to think about.

We think we know what others are thinking.

We project our current frame of mind onto the past and future.

**When we react quickly**

In order to act, we need to be confident in our ability to make a change and feel the importance of our actions.

Tend to prefer focusing on immediate and tangible outcomes rather than long-term and abstract result.

Prefer to complete what we have already invested time and effort in.

We tend to preserve personal autonomy and current status in a group by avoiding irrevocable decisions.

We tend to prefer simple and straightforward options over more complex and ambiguous ones.

**When we remember and recall**

We tend to edit and enhance memories after events have taken place.

We tend to disregard specifics in order to construct and solidify generalizations.

We simplify events and lists to individual key moments and elements.

We store memories differently depending on the context in which the experience was acquired.
